    <h2 id="What_Is_Heartbleed">What is Heartbleed?</h2>
    <p>Heartbleed is a vulnerability in the OpenSSL protocol that allows an attacker to steal protected information. Heartbleed would allow anyone on the Internet to read system memory, which includes secret keys, passwords, and other sensitive information.
      It affected 17% of all SSL servers, including companies like Google, Yahoo, Netflix, Facebook and even the FBI.</p>

    <h2 id="Heartbleed_History">A Short History of Heartbleed</h2>
    <p>The first person to discovery Heartbleed was Neel Mehta, an engineer at Google discovered the vulnerability in March 2014. They later published a website https://heartbleed.com/ to publicize the bug.
      The second discovery came from a Finnish cybersecurity firm Codenomicon just a couple weeks later. The company was working on a product called Safeguard, which would be an encryption and authentication targetted penetration testing tool.</p>

    <p>Your content for Section 3 goes here.</p>

    <h2 id="Heartbleed_Today">Heartbleed's Impact Today</h2>
    <p>Heartbleed was discovered in 2014, basically a decade ago, so is it still even relevant?
      According to the SANS institute in a <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/26798">2020 paper,</a>
      they used Shodan, basically a search engine for servers, showed that over 204,000 servers were still vulnerable to heartbleed.
      
    </p>

    <h2 id="Detect_Heartbleed">How to Detect Heartbleed</h2>
    <p>There are many ways to detect whether your system is vulnerable to Heartbleed. The methods we will go over include: manually checking, commandline tools, online tools, and vulnerability scanners.
    </p>
    <h3>Checking manually</h3>
    <p>Versions 1.0.1, 1.0.1a, 1.0.1b, 1.0.1c, 1.0.1d, 1.0.1e, 1.0.1f are vulnerable to the heartbleed bug. You can manually test this by typing </p>
      <pre><code>openssl version</code></pre> 
      <p>into your terminal, and if the results are not one of the mentioned versions, then your system is not vulnerable to heartbleed.
       </p>
    <h3>Commandline Tools</h3>
    <h4>OpenSSL tools</h4>
    You can use OpenSSL itself to check for heartbleed. Open the terminal and paste this command into it. It will say "safe" if your server is not vulnerable to heartbleed.
    <p><pre><code>echo "QUIT"|openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 2>&1|grep 'server extension "heartbeat" (id=15)' || echo safe</code></pre></p>
    
    <h4>nmap Scans</h4>
    <p>Another option is to use nmap. Nmap is a port scanning tool, which means it will scan an IP or domain for what ports and connections it has open,
      but it can detect for some vulnerabilities and other information as well.
    </p>
    <pre><code>nmap --script ssl-heartbleed -p 443 example.com</code></pre>
    <p>or</p>
    <pre><code>nmap --script ssl-heartbleed -p 443 198.168.1.1</code></pre>
    <p>Depending on whether you want to use an domain or an IP.</p>
    
    <h3>Online tools</h3>
    <h4>Qualys</h4>
    <p>Qualys makes a server scanner that looks at a lot of different things related to TLS. It will search for common vulnerabilities (heartbleed included!), as well as other common SSL attacks like POODLE. 
      It will also check some other basics such as certificates and ciphers they're using.
      If your server is on the public Internet, you can copy the link and paste it in <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">Qualys.</a></p>

    <h4>DomSignal</h4>
    <p>DomSignal is another server TLS scanner that will check for the health of your TLS implementation.
      Just like Qualys, it will search for common misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, including heartbleed.
      Once again, your server has to be on the public Internet, but you can copy the link and paste it here <a href="https://domsignal.com/tls-scanner">DomSignal.</a>
    </p>

    <h4>Vulnerability Scanners</h4>
    <p>Vulnerability scanners are pretty similar to the online tools mentioned above (they're both vulnerability scanners overall),
      but they'll have some slightly different implementation differences and capabilities. Some common scanners are Nessus and OpenVAS,
      and they will both scan your system for common misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. One of the advantages that these scanners have
      over the online tools like Qualys and DomSignal is customizability. Both Nessus and OpenVAS allows you to install additional plugins
      and settings for your vulnerability scan.
